There are some differences between the Propexo sandbox and production environments. It is important to be aware of these differences to avoid any issues with your integration development.

## Data Retention
- Sandbox has a data retention policy of 180 days per integration. This means that any data in the sandbox will be deleted after 180 days of inactivity for that integration.
- Production data retention is indefinite, but can be deleted upon request.

## Automatic Syncs
- Sandbox integrations do not automatically run syncs. You will need to manually run syncs for your sandbox integrations.
- Production integrations automatically run syncs. You have the option to run syncs on a standard schedule (e.g. every 24 hours), a custom schedule (e.g. every 20 minutes 9-5 M-F), or on-demand.

## Credentials
- Sandbox: Propexo can optionally provide a test environment against the Buildium API. We are not able to offer any other test environment at this time.
- Production: You are responsible for providing your own credentials for all PM Systems.
